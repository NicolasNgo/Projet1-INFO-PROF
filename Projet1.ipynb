        "The kidneys are responsable for removing wastes, toxins and extra water from the body; balancing important salts and minerals in the blood, such as calcium, sodium and potassium; and releasing hormones to help control blood pressure, make red blood cells and keep your bones strong. The waste and extra water removed by the kidneys become urine. \n",
        "\n",
        "When the kidneys are damaged, they can't filter blood as they should. The result can be a build-up of wastes in your body, as well as other problems that can harm your health. **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)** is a type of kidney disease in which there is a gradual loss of kidney function over a period of monthrs or years. It often can get worse over time and may lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, you will deen dialysis or kidney tranplant to maintain your health. \n",
        "\n",
        "Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of kidney disease. It's a common condition often associated with getting older. Usually in the early stages, there is no symptoms of CKD, but it may be detected with a blood and/or urine test. The tests look for high level of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys aren't working properly. For instance, we look for high level of albumin, which is a protein found in the blood. A healthy kidney doesn't let albumin pass into the urine. \n",
        "\n",
        "The data are blood tests and other measures from patients with and without CKD. There are 400 rows, one per patient; these are patients seen over a period of about two months at some point before July 2015 in a hospital in India. \n",
        "\n",
        "The `classification` column is the one to predict with `ckd` if the patient was diagnosed with CKD and `notckd` if not. A full dictionary is presented below:\n",
